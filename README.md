# Comparison of Sequence Augmentation Techniques for Protein Classification Tasks

This project is a comparison of several previously published protein sequence augmentation techniques for synthetic minority class oversampling for protein classification. Synthetic data generation methods such as SMOTE, ADASYN, image augmentation, and others are commonly used across a variety of domains machine learning to combat overfitting by artificially creating new samples, but have seen relatively little use for protein sequences. Here, I compare several published protein sequence augmentation techniques and find...
